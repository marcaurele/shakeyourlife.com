I didn’t hide anything... neither had time to make one. It’s not mine,
it’s my nephew, Louis ;-) My sister and her husband, Tijn, came to spend
almost 3 weeks around Christmas and New-Year with me in New-Zealand.

You can imagine that the van I bought wasn’t too much for all this
family traveling because we had: the baby bed, baby clothes & co, baby
seat, my sister’s & tijn’s stuff, mine as well, tijn’s kitesurfs,
kiteboard, wetsuit, harness, and the same for me, the full camping set
with chairs, stove, cooking set... And we had to squeeze all of it
between the bed and the 4th seat in the back. Each day it got a bit
better organized and by the end we were pretty quick to set up the camp
or to leave in the morning, as well as to find what we were looking
for.

We spent the first week and new-year with friends in the Bay of Islands,
north of Auckland. It’s such a nice place, and their house is somewhere
you wish to spend always more time. The view over the bay is just ...
like this!

And even when you’re cooking in the kitchen which is in the opposite way
of the bay, you just have to look into the window to have the reflection
of the bay... priceless

It was hard to leave the place with the great time we had with all the
Jack family

but we had to SEE NEW-ZEALAND, or at least I had to since my sister and
Tijn were already here.

To make it short we drove northern up to the cape Reinga and down the
west coast to Wellington, and here are some of the great places we’ve
been

Maitai Bay

In Wellington... I saw the IBM building, but I didn’t feel like going in
to check my emails ;-) And then we took the ferry to the South Island

Cape Farewell

Last but not least... how were these 3 weeks with my nephew you will ask
since I didn’t say much about it. Well I have to admit it was pretty
hard at the beginning to get into the baby pace of life and to get use
to all the stops and things to do for him. Can’t he just get a beer for
the apéro instead of his warm milk which implies to set up the stove and
everything? ;-) I guess it was also hard since we were just driving
everyday and not making more than short walks. So after the first couple
of kite sessions and a few days seeing Louis starting to smile when he
kind of recognized me, I must say that it was really nice.  

Thank you Elo, Tijn, Louis & the whole Jack family to set me on the rail
of my New-Zealand adventures :-)
