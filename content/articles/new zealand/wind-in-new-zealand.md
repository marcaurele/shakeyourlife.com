The wind in New-Zealand... A really good subject after the few months I
spent here. I've been wondering if someone had a Eole voodoo doll and
was playing with it to tease me. I spent the last days in Coromandel
since the wind forecast was supposed to be really good.  

I started yesterday early morning to kite in Whitianga with a light wind
compared to what they said in the forecast, but it didn't work so well.
It was kind of disappearing sometimes. I decided to head to the open sea
at Hot Water beach. There it was strong enough most of the time, very
very gusty though, up to 35 knots I think. Alone on the beach, big
waves... maybe not the best spot.  

I went back in Whitianga hopping it would get better there, but still
gusty & "ghosty" ...

What's wrong with the wind in NZ? It's been a while since I had a good
kiting day, and I hope I will have at least one more before leaving
New-Zealand in 2-3 weeks! Please stop playing with this voodoo doll!!!
Please...
