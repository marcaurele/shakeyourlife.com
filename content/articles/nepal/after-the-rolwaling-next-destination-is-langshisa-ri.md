I'm uploading some pictures of the previous trek in the Rolwaling but I
didn't write yet the post about the whole trek, so you will need to wait
more... (bad guy!). But you can check out the first pictures of the trek
at this address: <http://photos.shakeyourlife.com/>

Tomorrow we are going to leave, Gilles and me, to the Langtang National
Park, to climb the Langshisa Ri, 6427m. We finally get the permit today
after not being able to get one for the Larkya Ri in the Manaslu region.
We couldn't go on our own in this region and therefore we wouldn't get
the trekking permit for the Manaslu.

The trek & climbing should take us around 2 weeks so I will have a few
days left in Kathmandu to chill out and send back my climbing gears what
I won't need for the rest of my trip.
