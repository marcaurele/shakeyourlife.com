For the people who could hear what was going on in Nepal, or did
experience the Nepali demonstration in the street, one was going on the
day of my departure. At 10am, when I was eating my big last breakfast on
the terrace of the Hotel, I could hear all the shops pulling down the
shutters quickly and a lot of people coming in the street. One shop was
only about to pull down its shutters when one guy saw it and throw a
rock at it. Luckily for the owner, it bounced on the shutters. All of
them had rocks in both hands, and not small one!

When I left the Hotel, there were any richsaw, neither any taxi in the
street of Thamel. With the guys of the Hotel who helped me we walked out
of Thamel to hopefully find one at the big crossing, but nothing there
neither. The only transportation was a shuttle that the tourist police
had to organize for the foreigners to reach the airport. While driving
to one of the big hotel to take other passengers, I could see in the
street some broken glass and rocks in the streets... And almost no car,
neither local busses. And when we reached the other hotel I could
understand why. Also the bus driver of our bus was sitting on the left
side, which is the wrong side for Nepal. And so the previous shuttle bus
was parking there because its wind shield had been broken by some
rocks... It’s not going to be a safe trip... I’m sitting next to a
window and by the door but we have 3 tourist police officers in the bus
with us.  

At each crossing, the bus stopped 300m before to see if other police
officers were doing any sign to go further or to stop and wait. Finally
the bus reached the airport without any troubles, but it was the only
vehicle at the airport, no taxi, no minibus.
