I'm in Pokhara now for some days before the next trek/expedition,
depending on where we will go. At least it's a much better place to
celebrate my birthday than Kathmandu since the night-life isn't
"shutdown" at 23H (11pm)... And there is so much less noise and
pollution! And there is a french restaurant here. The menu for tonight
sounds good already.

</p>

Maybe tomorrow, I'll be able to do some kayaking, with a playboat!
That's going to be so fun!!! It's been a long time since my last kayak
run.

Thanks to everyone for your messages for this special day! I reset the
counter today... from 9 to 0. Let's start again for another decade of
fun, adventures, laughs and much more with all of you! It doesn't start
badly as you can see ;-)

</p>

Biz to all of you - Marco
