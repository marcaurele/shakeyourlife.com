The bungee jump at the Last Resort in Nepal was great, a huge jump for
my first one. And I really liked it. I would have done another one if
you didn't have to walk all the way back from down the river, it took
around 20 minutes...

I'm not the one jumping on the video. It's a Nepali guy, and most of
them were really scared since they couldn't "jump"... they seemed to
loose their power in their legs. The guy is just falling like a rock...

And watch carefully the elastic during the jump, by the end of the video
it isn't even stretched ;-)
