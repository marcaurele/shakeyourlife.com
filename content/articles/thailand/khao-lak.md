I just arrived in Khao Lak to go with Seadragon on a liveaboard diving
trip for 4 days in the Similan islands. At least, I already know what I
won't stay more than 1 night when I will be back here. I don't know if
I've been spoiled with the landscape of the islands, but if the beach
doesn't have a white sand, it looks ugly... Moreover, the village by
itself, there's nothing nice. Why do tourists come here? Don't they want
to have a better look of Thailand and visit the islands?

</p>

I'm really exited for this boat diving trip. I will miss the full moon
party, but I will dive in the best diving spots of Thailand. The full
moon party will still be there when the marine life will be dead... so
first the diving before it's too late on this earth ;-)
