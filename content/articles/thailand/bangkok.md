Since the 20th I'm in Bangkok, and really enjoyed my time here. The city
is really full of things to do, and it's also so nice to be back in a
nice and warm weather. It started to be cold in Nepal...  

I came here with allmost no clothes, and spent the 3 first days at
different market places to buy tee-shirts, shorts, swim-pants... to be
ready for the beaches and the big summer season I have in front of me.
The clothes are cheap, and you can even find real brands for cheaper
than in Europe. Next time for sure, I will come with a completely empty
backpack. You don't need anything when you come here.

Now, it's time to go on the beach and I'll be leaving tonight for Ko
Lanta to start my diving courses :-) And to get some more sun tun ;-)

</p>

The cybercafe is pretty bad, but cheap, and I can't upload any pictures,
so the rest of the pics from Nepal and the first of Thailand (city,
temples...) will need to wait (as usual).

I also got my X10 from Suunto, so I have my wrist GPS to be able to send
my special GPS messages from my mobile phone. You should be able to
follow my trip in the South with more updates on my website.
