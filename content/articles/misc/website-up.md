Finally the website is up. I (almost) finished the design today and I'm
happy to share it with you. Everything is not ready now but you will see
more goodies coming time by time (at least if you're coming back here
;-)

</p>

If you're using Internet Explorer 6 or below I would guess that the
design looks like shit ... it's the price to pay by using a crappy web
browser. I can't test it for the moment and I don't even know if I'll
try to fix it. Use IE7 or [Firefox][].

I will try to add the story of my past expedition in Argentina in 2006
at the Mercedario. It will be a good reading before starting with my
Round World Tour.

48 days left...
