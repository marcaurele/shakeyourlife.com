What a hell did I come up with? Well I thought it wouldn't be a tough
trip without something very demanding at the and of my trip as it was at
the beginning. So I decided to join two English guys to bike the Great
Divide with them.

I met Simon when I was between my expeditions in Nepal and during the
many hours we all gathered together with the group, we talked about our
plans for our long time of travel. That's how I first heard about this
crazy long biking trip. First I wasn't thinking to change so much my
plans and just said that I will join them as soon as I'm on the mainland
in the US. But the more I was thinking about biking and doing sports in
New-Zealand, the more I wished to do the full trip. So I asked Simon and
Ollie if I could join them from the beginning, which they gently agree
on.  

You would tell me that we have no clue on what we're gonna experience
with me. It's half true. I spent again days with Simon in New-Zealand
hiking and traveling, but I don't know yet Ollie. It's his cousin, so no
worries!

So here I am, with my untrained legs since many months whiling to bike
for 4400km! No you're not dreaming! It's really long... And moreover
it's through the Rocky mountains from Banff in Canada, to Antelope Wells
in New-Mexico state in the US. It won't be a piece of cake at all, but
I'm looking so much forward this bike adventure! So much that the IT
geek I am, launched another special website for the occasion. All the
information will be there about the trip. There will still be my GPS
messages on ShakeYourLife.com and I might post some personal stories on
it. So now you will have 2 websites to look at during the summer to keep
you busy if the financial crisis isn't giving you enough work ;)

And here you go -\> <http://www.bikingthegreatdivide.com>  

There is a link in the left menu as well in case you'll forget it ;)  

You will find all the information regarding the team, the route, the
preparation...

Am I gonna survive with the Grizzlies? Lack of water? Desert & heat in
New-Mexico? Reply in a many weeks...
