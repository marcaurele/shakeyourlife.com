I'm done with some reading, excellent one actually. If you want to read
something refreshing for your mind, and to get to know why sometimes
your thoughts are corrupted by your likes, dislikes, prejudices and
stereotypes, and how they can be overloaded by too much information...
Some ideas on what is going on on your subconscious level. I can
recommend you this excellent book!

<!--break--><!--break-->

What I found so nice in this book is all the information you're
processing on a subconscious level. It can come from your experience,
your education, your dreams. The writing is enjoyable and it will be
read quite fast.

Since I will have plenty of time for reading, I'm wide open to get any
good tips on books, specially books that make you think. You can leave
me a comment here.  

I will post on the blog all the good books I will be reading during my
big holidays for you.
