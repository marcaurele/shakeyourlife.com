I left Lausanne six months ago, but it feels like an eternity! So many
things happened since then, but the best of all for me, is that I still
have another six months left to do even more crazy stuff.

For this special date, I had to celebrate it, so I bought some NZ
Champagne (alike) and drank all by myself since I was alone on my beach
this night.

And yes I will be back mid-september 2009 in Lausanne... and more news
later about a big adventure I'm preparing.
