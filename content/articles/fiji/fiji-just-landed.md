I just landed in Fiji ... under the rain! No internet for 1 week because
on the island there isn't any access... just the beach, kayaks,
kitesurf, wakeboard. Why would I need internet anyway in paradise :-)

</p>

Maybe I would be able to update the website with some SMS (GPS message).

It feels very nice to be back in the hot & humid climat... I start to
remember Thailand and also the first days in Kathmandu. Auckland started
to be a bit cold for me ;-)

</p>

Enjoy your "spring" time, I'll enjoy the cocktail on the beach :-)
