Let me explain to you what is a GPS message that you can see on my blog.

I had an idea to have a more active blog during my trip with the help of
Web2.0 services on the internet. So the concept is that with my mobile
phone, I write a SMS containing my current GPS location, which I get
with my Suunto X10 GPS watch  

(gracefully sponsored). Then I send this SMS to a special number and use
a service on Internet to retrieve this message on my website. When a new
one comes in, I create automatically a blog entry with the GoogleMap and
my text attached into the SMS.

In that way I can update my website without having direct access to
Internet and you can get a closer overview of what crazy things I'm
doing right now ;-)

And if you better understand with pictures, here are the steps
